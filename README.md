# Homework Refractor Assignment

## The Repository
This repository is where I pushed my first completed homework assignment. In this assignment I was able to take the code given and change it to follow a logical structure.

## Motivation
My motivation for this assignment was that I want to be able to understand how the world of coding works and this takes me one step closer.

## Screenshot
Here is a screenshot of the completed website.
